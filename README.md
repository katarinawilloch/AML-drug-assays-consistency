## üß∞ Project Overview

This project performs statistical modeling and generates diagnostic plots to evaluate model assumptions and performance. It is written in R using packages like `lme4`, `ggplot2`, and `dplyr`.

### üîç Key Features
- Cleans and processes input data
- Perfomes some exploratory analysis
- Fits mixed-effects models using `lmer()`
- Produces diagnostic plots for residuals, random effects, and influential points

## üñºÔ∏è Supplementary Diagnostic Plots

The following image shows an example of a diagnodtic plot for the Time until Usage LMM fitted on transformed DSS2 values. It helps assess normality, homoscedasticity, and influential observations. 
The rest of the supplementary diagnostic plots following the article can be found in [Supplementary Diagnostic Plots](https://github.com/katarinawilloch/AML-drug-assays-consistency/tree/main/Diagnostic%20plots)
